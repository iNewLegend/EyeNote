# Never use relative imports

Always use workspace imports instead of relative paths.

## Examples

✅ Correct - Workspace imports:
```typescript
import { Button } from "@eye-note/ui";
import { useAppAuth } from "@eye-note/auth/app";
import { resolveBackendUrl } from "@eye-note/backend-health/src/resolve-backend-url";
```

❌ Incorrect - Relative imports:
```typescript
import { Button } from "../ui";
import { useAppAuth } from "./use-app-auth-store";
import { resolveBackendUrl } from "./resolve-backend-url";
```

## Rule

- Never use relative imports (`./`, `../`)
- Always use workspace package imports (`@eye-note/<package>/...`)
- This applies to both cross-package and intra-package imports
